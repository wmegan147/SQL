#This project reveals insights about customers and their orders, employee information, and musical data for a digital media store.

# The following SQL was written to answer specific questions about customers and sales data:

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT firstname, lastname, customerid, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers c
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE i.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title like '%agent%';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
select distinct BillingCountry
from chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
select i.invoiceid, c.customerid, e.firstname, e.lastname
FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerid = c.customerid
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
select c.firstname, c.lastname, c.country, e.firstname, e.lastname, i.total
FROM chinook.customers c 
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.customerid = c.customerid;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(Invoicedate)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '%2009%';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '%2009%';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name, i.invoicelineid
FROM tracks t
JOIN invoice_items i
ON t.trackid = i.trackid;

#11. Show the total sales made by each sales agent
SELECT c.supportrepid, e.firstname, e.lastname, ROUND(SUM(i.total)) as 'Total Sales'
FROM customers c
JOIN invoices i
ON c.customerid = i.customerid
JOIN employees e
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
GROUP BY e.firstname
