#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
select count(orderID)
from JanSales
where length(OrderID)=6 AND orderID<>'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
select count(Product)
from JanSales
where Product='iPhone' AND length(OrderID)=6 AND orderID<>'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers cust
INNER JOIN FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
select product, MIN(price)
FROM JanSales
where length(OrderID)=6 AND orderID<>'Order ID'
ORDER BY price asc;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
from JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select * from FebSales;
select product, quantity, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
from FebSales
where location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select 
count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
